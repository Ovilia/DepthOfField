About
-----
Traditional rendering makes scenes distinct everywhere, which, in most cases, seems unreal to human eyes. So objects out of focal distance should be defocused (blurred) and objects in focus stay clear. [Depth of field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field) is one of the feasible ways to achieve this.

This project aims to implement real-time depth of field rendering by [WebGL](http://www.khronos.org/webgl/), with the help of [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/).
